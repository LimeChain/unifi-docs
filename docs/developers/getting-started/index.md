# Building on UniFi

UniFi is mostly EVM equivalent, which means that developers can use familiar EVM tools and frameworks,
such as Hardhat, Truffle, and Remix, to interact with and develop on UniFi.
This compatibility significantly reduces the learning curve, allowing developers to leverage existing skills and knowledge.

For exact differences between UniFi and EVM behaviour, see the [Opcodes](../reference/opcodes.md) page.
